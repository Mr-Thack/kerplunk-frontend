# KerPlunk
A Holding Directory for our new chatting app

# Alert(s):
We're using SvelteKit, which is just a router for Svelte.
Basically, it automatically figures out how to structure the files.
Go learn Svelte, one of the easiest (& newest) of the JS frameworks.
We also use PicnicCSS, lightweight but nice looking.

# Run The Frontend:
Install node then yarn.

Then run:
```
yarn install
```
to install dependcies for this project.

Then run:
```
yarn run dev
```
to compile and serve the HTML. Then minimze the terminal and work.
If you get weird errors, then check the minimized terminal.

# Run The Backend!!!
You'll need to run the backendd seperately. Especially since we're testing.
Go to https://github.com/Mr-Thack/kerplunk-backend and clone this one.
Then run it in a seperate terminal.

# Note:
There'll probably be weird bugs...
So text me if something doesn't work right.
